This code is meant to read the angle of an arm movement. Linked below is an Onshape file on the mechanism the rotary encoder is installed into in order to read the angle of the arm. This is very basic code and would obviously be reiterated and drawn up again in order to accomplish the goal of the code and mechanism.
